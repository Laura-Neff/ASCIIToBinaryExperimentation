# ASCIIToBinaryExperimentation

A Java program for my Computer Organization and Assembler Programming class. The objective was to write a Nano class that represents a special numbering system called "Nano numbers" for the assignment that would parse the "Nano" number representations (#,  !,  %,  @,  (,  ),  [,  ],  $,) into integers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) respectively, as well as convert the integers we're used to into strings so they can be read in the Nano numbering system. This project is used to demonstrate what the computer does when the user gives it a string that she wants to parse into an integer and vice versa, since the binary in the ASCII representation of integers is different than the actual number in binary that is used for arithmetic and logic calculations.
